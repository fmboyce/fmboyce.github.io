                				<br>
                				Iâ€™m a PADI Divemaster, which is the first professional scuba diving qualification enabling me to lead dives with qualified customers. This is a challenging role to be in, as diving is truly a safety critical environment where I am responsible for their safety as well as my own. Leading dives exposes me to a variety of new situations that require quick decisions, a high level of multitasking and excellent communication skills.

	               				 <br>
	                			Last year I was Trip Secretary for Imperial College Snowsports Club, my main duty was organizing the winter trip for 150 people which was successful. I have also worked as a tour representative for Exeter University Snowsports, taking their trip to the Alps last December was a challenging week where I was responsible for ensuring a coach of 70 students arrived in resort on time and had a smooth enjoyable week.

              					A sport I have enjoyed for many years, I climb regularly at an indoor gym with Imperial College Mountaineering Club and occasionally attend outdoor trips at the weekends.
